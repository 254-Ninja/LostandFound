  Lost and Found App project design 

Background 

We lose valuable items every day. Whenever I log in on any social media, I find posts of people who have lost items or have found an item but have no clue of how to reach out to the owner. This problem does not only affect material goods but also pets and, to an extent, our loved ones. It is common to find posts of missing pets or persons daily.
 
This gap has led to the need for a one-stop app that allows users to find and post found goods. The primary objective is to make it easier for individuals to recover lost items and reconnect with their loved ones. 

Objective

Initially, I will develop an android app. Create a central platform that enables information flow for people seeking to recover their items. Make it easy for one to report a lost item and facilitate the collection of the said items.

Concept 

Whenever you lose an item, there is always a possibility that it will end up in the hands of a stranger. The goal is to connect the owner of the item and the finder. 
The app will allow the owner to post the lost item, and users can view lost items on the home page. The finder can directly reach out to the owner via the chat option. 

Owner

File for a lost item --> Access a list of items matching the description --> Reach out to a finder --> verify identity and ownership.
The owner has to verify their identity before collecting the item they are claiming. 

Design 

User Page

My first tab will be the user profile. It is the page that allows you to access the app. It consists of a simple profile indicating your name and contacts.

Reporting form page

These pages will consist of a form that allows you to add the picture of the item, the description, and the time frame. 

Search Tab

The search tab will have a list view to allow you to pick either claimed or unclaimed items. Your selection will bring you to a search bar that opens a list view of either claimed or unclaimed items.

Chat page

The chat page will enable the owner and the finder to communicate. 

Notification bar 
The notification bar will notify you whenever an item matching your description is uploaded or claimed by someone else. 

Slider pages 

Login and signup page

For this pages, I will use firebase to verify login details.
