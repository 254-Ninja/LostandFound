"# LostandFound" 
  Lost and Found App project design 

Background 

We lose valuable items every day. Whenever I log in on any social media, I find posts of people who have lost items or have found an item but have no clue of how to reach out to the owner. This problem does not only affect material goods but also pets and, to an extent, our loved ones. It is common to find posts of missing pets or persons daily.
 
This gap has led to the need for a one-stop app that allows users to find and post found goods. The primary objective is to make it easier for individuals to recover lost items and reconnect with their loved ones. 

Objective

Initially, I will develop an android app. Create a central platform that enables information flow for people seeking to recover their items. Make it easy for one to report a lost item and facilitate the collection of the said items.

Concept 
whenever you lose an item, there is always a possbility that it will end up in the hands of a stranger. The goal is to connect the owner of the item and the finder. 
The app will allow the owner to post the lost item, and users can view lost items on the home page. The finder can directly reach out to the owner via the chat option.
