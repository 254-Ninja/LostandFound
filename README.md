"# LostandFound" 
  Lost and Found App project design 

Background 

We lose valuable items every day. Whenever I log in on any social media, I find posts of people who have lost items or have found an item but have no clue of how to reach out to the owner. This problem does not only affect material goods but also pets and, to an extent, our loved ones. It is common to find posts of missing pets or persons daily.
 
This gap has led to the need for a one-stop app that allows users to find and post found goods. The primary objective is to make it easier for individuals to recover lost items and reconnect with their loved ones.
